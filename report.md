# Module 1 Codexes Claims Analysis
In this assignment, I analyzed data collected from "https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/67157de9-d962-4af0-bf0e-3578b3afec58/inpatient.csv." I separated ICD, DRG and HCPCS codes and analyzed the following:
ICD_DGNS_CD1
ICD_DGNS_CD7
ICD_DGNS_CD22
ICD_PRCDR_CD3
ICD_PRCDR_CD7
ICD_PRCDR_CD13

CLM_DRG_CD
CLM_DRG_OUTLIER_STAY_CD
CLM_PPS_CPTL_DRG_WT_NUM

CHCPCS_CD

All of the above codes were further analyzed and identified by utilizing the "CODEBOOK: Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS)
Claims (version L)" 

In addition, particular ICD diagnosis codes were further analyzed with the website, "https://www.icd10data.com/"

Challenges that I encountered include the difficulty and precision required to handle these large data sets. It is very easy to make an error in the line of code which can lead to incorrect outputs.

The implications of my findings for healthcare providers and policy makers can assist in multiple facets of healthcare. Frequency of certain diagnoses (ICD codes) can lead healthcare providers and policymakers to make adjustments to their community based care models. Therefore, policy makers and other stakeholders can more effectively allocate funds, support, and resources to the areas and patient populations requiring the most assistance.
